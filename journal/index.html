                <h2>BEST PRACTICES FOR MODAL DESIGN</h2>
                <p>January 28, 2026</p>
                
                <p>I enjoyed reading the article <a href="https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-modals-overlays-dialog-windows-c00c66cddd8c"> Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows.</a> I’ve always found modals, overlays, dialogs, or popups as I call them, annoying because of how they’re designed. They usually appear unexpectedly and interrupt users when they’re trying to complete a task. Just like unwanted ads, they distract users in order to gain their full attention for something important. Other common uses include forms such as newsletter sign-ups or login and registration prompts.</p>


                <p>These elements can greatly impact a user’s experience depending on how well they’re executed, so this article was really informative in explaining best practices. The first thing the article covers is the anatomy of a modal window. It’s important to include a clear way to close it, clear and descriptive titles and button labels, appropriate size and location, focused attention with a darkened background, and to keep modals user-initiated rather than randomly popping up.</p>


                <p>Working with mobile can also be difficult because modals can end up being too large or too small on the screen. Overall, there’s a lot to consider, with accessibility being one of the most important factors. Following ARIA guidelines can help create more accessible modals. In conclusion, modals are useful for getting a user’s attention and helping them complete important tasks, but they also have downsides. They can interrupt user flow and make it impossible to interact with the original parent page.</p>

                <h2>BEST PRACTICES FOR FORM DESIGN</h2>
                <p>January 17, 2026</p>
                
                <p>Reading through the article <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">Best Practices for Form Design</a> was really insightful. I’ve always used forms to fill out various things, whether surveys or job applications, but I hadn’t really thought about the exact practices that should be used or how much thought goes into them.</p>


                <p>I’m familiar with basic UI design practices, but this article highlighted things that I’ve actually experienced before, both when filling out forms and creating my own. One thing it brought up was pain points users have with inline labels. It’s better to place labels above the input field because if they’re inline, the label disappears, and the user might forget what they need to input. I learned about this while working on a UI/UX project in DI’s Cohort, where I was tasked with designing the onboarding process. I had also used inline labels for our onboarding form, but when we conducted user testing, the same pain point came up. Since then, I’ve noticed whether a form I’m filling out follows this design principle or not.</p>


                <p>One example of a good form that uses these practices is the <a href="https://apply.calhacks.io/">CalHacks application form</a>, as well as our new HackDavis application form! We just started working on it last quarter, but it draws a lot of inspiration and design principles from CalHacks, so it provides a great user experience. Some of these practices include asking the easy questions first, properly using labels, and providing a progress bar. I can’t wait for users to try it out once applications open and seehow it compares to CalHacks!</p>
